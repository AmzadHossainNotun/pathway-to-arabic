# Resources to Learn Arabic Poetry 

In this section you will find resources to help you study arabic poetry and literature. Understanding classical Arabic poetry is extremely important to gain an indepth understanding of the language of the Quran.

!!! quote "Importance of learning Arabic Poetry"
    ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas used to cite poetry a lot to explain the verses of the Quran. He used to say: “If your read something in the Quran that you do not understand then look for its meaning in the poetry of the Arabs, for poetry is the Diwan of the Arabs”. His story with the Kharijite Nafi’ Ibn Al-Azraq and the eminent poet ‘Umar bin Rabi’ah is well known. The legacy of citing poetry to explain the Quran was preserved by the exegetists (Al-mufassirun). The books of Tafsir are filled with verses of poetry.
