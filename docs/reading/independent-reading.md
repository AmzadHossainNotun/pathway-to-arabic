# Independent Reading

This section has a list of useful books to read on your own. Reading a translation side by side, where available, can be helpful. Some of these books also have accompanying audio to overcome the challenge of reading without tashkeel (vowel signs). These books will help you transition from guided reading to independent reading, insha Allah.

!!! tip "This is a work in progress and I will keep adding new books/resources so please check back often."

## **العربية للناشئين**

This is a famous book series for teaching Arabic to non-native speakers. But rather than going through the complete text books, I would recommend to use only the texts in the books as independent reading practice. 

[Arabic.ba](https://arabic.ba) is an excellent website where you can read all texts from these books without downloading and navigating the textbooks. 

To help ease into reading without vowel signs, this website is equipped with a simple switch panel at the top of the page, which allows the user to control the vocalization (تَشْكِيلٌ) of the text. The user can choose to show or hide short vowels (حَرَكَاتٌ) at the beginning (أَوَّلُ الْكَلِمَةِ), the middle (وَسْطُ الْكَلِمَةِ) and the end (آخِرُ الْكَلِمَةِ) of each word of the text. Read more about their methodolgy [here](https://arabic.ba/practice/reading/help/).

## **التفسير الميسر**

_by a group of prominent scholars, initiative King Fahad Printing Press_

![al-Tafseer al-Muyassar](/img/tafseer-muyassar.jpg)

This tafseer is in simple Arabic, using only simple and easy phrases and words throughout the Tafseer, along with explaining the difficult words. The tafseer is simplified and summarized, from the works of the greatest Imaams of tafseer and explains the meaning of the ayaat directly, without quoting any narrations except where necessary. Which makes it a good starting book for the students of Arabic before delving into more complex books of tafseer.
