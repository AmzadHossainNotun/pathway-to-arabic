# Guided Reading

The best way to learn a language is dynamic immersion - to surround yourself with that language by reading, writing, and listening to living content. Luckily we have any number of books to increase our knowledge of Quran Arabic.

But reading a book in a new language can be daunting. Guided reading - or reading while a teacher / mentor explains and corrects is a really good way to overcome the challenge.

In this section you will find a list of many classical Arabic books along with videos and audios to give you a guided reading experience even when you don't have a teacher or mentor to help. The books are starting from easy and going all the way to more difficult ones.

Please note that I am only sharing classical books and Islamic literature on this site. If you want to practice reading Arabic through other contemporary books (like story books and modern text) you can join my Facebook group [Pathway to Arabic](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pathwaytoarabic) where I share more contemporary resources as well.

!!! tip "This is a work in progress and I will keep adding new books/resources so please check back often."

**Prerequisite for this section**

You can start reading these books alongside other courses. But ideally you should first complete the three Madinah Books before you will be able to understand these books.
