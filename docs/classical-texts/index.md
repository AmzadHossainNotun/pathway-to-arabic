![Sharh Qatr-an-Nada](/img/qatr-an-nada.png)

<br>

This brilliant book will assist in revising and refreshing your previously-learnt rules of grammar, while simultaneously allowing you to implement them into one’s readings. Since you will already be familiar with a significant amount of their contents, it is only a matter of increasing your knowledge of the science while exposing oneself to the Arabic style. ~ [at-Tahawi - MUSLIM BIBLIOPHILIA](https://attahawi.com/2015/09/19/arabic-reading-list-for-students-of-knowledge-by-mawlana-shahin-ur-rahman/){target=\_blank}

The Qatr is considered an intermediate level text and provides more detail than the Ajurrumiyya and also discusses issues that do not appear in the latter.
